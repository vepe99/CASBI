  abstract = {Using a large sample of main sequence stars with 7D measurements supplied by Gaia and SDSS, we study the kinematic properties of the local (within {$\sim$}10 kpc from the Sun) stellar halo. We demonstrate that the halo's velocity ellipsoid evolves strongly with metallicity. At the low[Fe/H] end, the orbital anisotropy (the amount of motion in the radial direction compared with the tangential one) is mildly radial, with 0.2 {$<\beta<$} 0.4. For stars with [Fe/H] {$>$} -1.7, however, we measure extreme values of {$\beta\sim$} 0.9. Across the metallicity range considered, namely -3 {$<$} [Fe/H] {$<$} -1, the stellar halo's spin is minimal, at the level of 20 {$<$} v{\textasciimacron}{\texttheta} (kms-1) {$<$} 30. Using a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of halo formation, we deduce that the observed acute anisotropy is inconsistent with the continuous accretion of dwarf satellites. Instead, we argue, the stellar debris in the inner halo was deposited in a major accretion event by a satellite with Mvir {$>$} 1010M around the epoch of the Galactic disc formation, between 8 and 11 Gyr ago. The radical halo anisotropy is the result of the dramatic radialization of the massive progenitor's orbit, amplified by the action of the growing disc.},

  abstract = {The inference of physical parameters from measured distributions constitutes a core task in physics data analyses. Among recent deep learning methods, so-called conditional invertible neural networks provide an elegant approach owing to their probability-preserving bijective mapping properties. They enable training the parameter-observation correspondence in one mapping direction and evaluating the parameter posterior distributions in the reverse direction. Here, we study the inference of cosmic-ray source properties from cosmic-ray observations on Earth using extensive astrophysical simulations. We compare the performance of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs) with the frequently used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. While cINNs are trained to directly predict the parameters' posterior distributions, the MCMC method extracts the posterior distributions through a likelihood function that matches simulations with observations. Overall, we find good agreement between the physics parameters derived by the two different methods. As a result of its computational efficiency, the cINN method allows for a swift assessment of inference quality.},

  abstract = {JWST observations have the potential to provide unprecedented constraints on the history of reionization and the sources responsible for the ionizing photons due to the detection of large populations of faint galaxies at {$z$} {$\gg$} 6. Modelling reionization requires knowing both the number of ionizing photons that are produced by galaxies and the fraction of those photons that escape into the intergalactic medium. Observational estimates of these values generally rely on spectroscopy for which large samples with well-defined selection functions remain limited. To overcome this challenge, we present an implicit likelihood inference (ILI) pipeline trained on mock photometry to predict the escaped ionizing luminosity of individual galaxies ({$n$}ion) based on photometric magnitudes and redshifts. Compared to traditional SED-fitting methods, the new ILI pipeline is consistently more accurate and significantly faster. We deploy the method on a sample of 4,559 high-redshift galaxies from the JADES Deep survey, finding a gentle redshift evolution of log10 ({$n$}ion) = (0.08 {\textpm} 0.01){$z$} + (51.60 {\textpm} 0.06), with late-time values for {$N$}ion consistent with theoretical models and observations. We measure the evolution of the volume-averaged ionized fraction and optical depth to find that observed populations of star-forming galaxies are capable of driving reionization to completion at {$z$} {$\sim$} 5.3 without the need for AGN or other exotic sources. The 20\% of UV-brightest galaxies ({$M$}UV {$<$} -18.5) in our sample can reionize only {$\sim$} 30\% of the survey volume, demonstrating that faint LyC emitters are crucial for reionization.},

We test and benchmark some of these new techniques in a community data challenge ``Beyond-2pt'', initiated during the Aspen 2022 Summer Program ``Large-Scale Structure Cosmology beyond 2-Point Statistics,'' whose first round of results we present here. The challenge dataset consists of high-precision mock galaxy catalogs for clustering in real space, redshift space, and on a light cone. Participants in the challenge have developed end-to-end pipelines to analyze mock catalogs and extract unknown (``masked'') cosmological parameters of the underlying {$\Lambda$}CDM models with their methods. The methods represented are density-split clustering, nearest neighbor statistics, BACCO power spectrum emulator, void statistics, LEFTfield field-level inference using effective field theory (EFT), and joint power spectrum and bispectrum analyses using both EFT and simulation-based inference. In this work, we review the results of the challenge, focusing on problems solved, lessons learned, and future research needed to perfect the emerging beyond-2pt approaches. The unbiased parameter recovery demonstrated in this challenge by multiple statistics and the associated modeling and inference frameworks supports the credibility of cosmology constraints from these methods.

  abstract = {Modern theories of galaxy formation predict that the Galactic stellar halo was hierarchically assembled from the accretion and disruption of smaller systems. This hierarchical assembly is expected to produce a high degree of structure in the combined phase and chemistry space; this structure should provide a relatively direct probe of the accretion history of our Galaxy. Revealing this structure requires precise 3D positions (including distances), 3D velocities, and chemistry for large samples of stars. The Gaia satellite is delivering proper motions and parallaxes for {$>$}1 billion stars to G{$\approx$}20. However, radial velocities and metallicities will only be available to G{$\approx$}15, which is insufficient to probe the outer stellar halo (10 kpc). Moreover, parallaxes will not be precise enough to deliver high-quality distances for stars beyond {$\sim$}10 kpc. Identifying accreted systems throughout the stellar halo therefore requires a large ground-based spectroscopic survey to complement Gaia. Here we provide an overview of the H3 Stellar Spectroscopic Survey, which will deliver precise stellar parameters and spectrophotometric distances for {$\approx$}200,000 stars to r=18. Spectra are obtained with the Hectochelle instrument at the MMT, which is configured for the H3 Survey to deliver resolution R{$\approx$}23,000 spectra covering the wavelength range 5150--5300 {\AA}. The survey is optimized for stellar halo science and therefore focuses on high Galactic latitude fields ({$\mid$}b{$\mid$} {$>$} 30), sparsely sampling 15,000 sq. degrees. Targets are selected on the basis of Gaia parallaxes, enabling very efficient selection of bona fide halo stars. The survey began in the fall of 2017 and has collected 88,000 spectra to-date. All of the data, including the derived stellar parameters, will eventually be made publicly available via the survey website: h3survey.rc.fas.harvard.edu.},

In this paper, we investigate using the chemical abundance ratio distributions (CARDs) of seven stellar halos from the Latte suite of FIRE-2 simulations. We attempt to infer galaxies' assembly histories by modeling the CARDs of the stellar halos of the Latte galaxies as a linear combination of               template               CARDs from disrupted dwarfs, with different stellar masses               M               {$\star$}               and quenching times               t               100               . We present a method for constructing these templates using present-day dwarf galaxies. For four of the seven Latte halos studied in this work, we recover the mass spectrum of accreted dwarfs to a precision of {$<$}10\%. For the fraction of mass accreted as a function of               t               100               , we find the residuals of 20\%--30\% for five of the seven simulations. We discuss the failure modes of this method, which arise from the diversity of star formation and chemical enrichment histories that dwarf galaxies can take. These failure cases can be robustly identified by the high model residuals. Although the CARDs modeling method does not successfully infer the assembly histories in these cases, the CARDs of these disrupted dwarfs contain signatures of their unusual formation histories. Our results are promising for using CARDs to learn more about the histories of the progenitors of the MW and M31 stellar halos.},

Building on recent advances in generative modeling, we here present flow matching posterior estimation (FMPE), a technique for SBI using continuous normalizing flows. Like diffusion models, and in contrast to discrete flows, flow matching allows for unconstrained architectures, providing enhanced flexibility for complex data modalities. Flow matching, therefore, enables exact density evaluation, fast training, and seamless scalability to large architectures---making it ideal for SBI. We show that FMPE achieves competitive performance on an established SBI benchmark, and then demonstrate its improved scalability on a challenging scientific problem: for gravitational-wave inference, FMPE outperforms methods based on comparable discrete flows, reducing training time by 30\% with substantially improved accuracy. Our work underscores the potential of FMPE to enhance performance in challenging inference scenarios, thereby paving the way for more advanced applications to scientific problems.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Accreted stellar populations are comprised of the remnants of destroyed galaxies, and often dominate the `stellar haloes' of galaxies such as the Milky Way (MW). This ensemble of external contributors is a key indicator of the past assembly history of a galaxy. We introduce a novel statistical method that uses the unbinned metallicity distribution function (MDF) of a stellar population to estimate the mass spectrum of its progenitors. Our model makes use of the well-known mass--metallicity relation of galaxies and assumes Gaussian MDF distributions for individual progenitors: the overall MDF is thus a mixture of MDFs from smaller galaxies. We apply the method to the stellar halo of the MW, as well as the classical MW satellite galaxies. The stellar components of the satellite galaxies have relatively small sample sizes, but we do not find any evidence for accreted populations with L \&gt; Lhost/100. We find that the MW stellar halo has N {$\sim$} 1-3 massive progenitors (L {$\greaterequivlnt$} 108L{$\odot$}) within 10~kpc, and likely several hundred progenitors in total. We also test our method on simulations of MW-mass haloes, and find that our method is able to recover the true accreted population within a factor of 2. Future data sets will provide MDFs with orders of magnitude more stars, and this method could be a powerful technique to quantify the accreted populations down to the ultra-faint dwarf mass scale for both the MW and its satellites.},

  abstract = {Simulation-based inference (SBI) solves statistical inverse problems by repeatedly running a stochastic simulator and inferring posterior distributions from modelsimulations. To improve simulation efficiency, several inference methods take a sequential approach and iteratively adapt the proposal distributions from which model simulations are generated. However, many of these sequential methods are difficult to use in practice, both because the resulting optimisation problems can be challenging and efficient diagnostic tools are lacking. To overcome these issues, we present Truncated Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation (TSNPE). TSNPE performs sequential inference with truncated proposals, sidestepping the optimisation issues of alternative approaches. In addition, TSNPE allows to efficiently perform coverage tests that can scale to complex models with many parameters. We demonstrate that TSNPE performs on par with previous methods on established benchmark tasks. We then apply TSNPE to two challenging problems from neuroscience and show that TSNPE can successfully obtain the posterior distributions, whereas previous methods fail.

  abstract = {The Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) survey is a large high-resolution spectroscopic survey using the newly commissioned High Efficiency and Resolution Multi-Element Spectrograph (HERMES) on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The HERMES spectrograph provides high-resolution (R {$\sim$} 28 000) spectra in four passbands for 392 stars simultaneously over a 2 deg field of view. The goal of the survey is to unravel the formation and evolutionary history of the Milky Way, using fossil remnants of ancient star formation events which have been disrupted and are now dispersed throughout the Galaxy. Chemical tagging seeks to identify such dispersed remnants solely from their common and unique chemical signatures; these groups are unidentifiable from their spatial, photometric or kinematic properties. To carry out chemical tagging, the GALAH survey will acquire spectra for a million stars down to V {$\sim$} 14. The HERMES spectra of FGK stars contain absorption lines from 29 elements including light proton-capture elements, {$\alpha$}-elements, odd-Z elements, iron-peak elements and n-capture elements from the light and heavy s-process and the r-process. This paper describes the motivation and planned execution of the GALAH survey, and presents some results on the first-light performance of HERMES.},

We overcome this constraint by a training procedure that uses an efficient estimator for the gradient of the change of variables formula. This enables any dimension-preserving neural network to serve as a generative model through maximum likelihood training. Our approach allows placing the emphasis on tailoring inductive biases precisely to the task at hand. Specifically, we achieve excellent results in molecule generation benchmarks utilizing \$E(n)\$-equivariant networks.

In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs --extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and nonlinearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

We introduce practical approaches for frequentist and Bayesian dataset-wide probabilistic inference in cases where the likelihood is intractable, but simulations can be realized via a hierarchical forward model. We construct neural estimators for the likelihood(-ratio) or posterior and show that explicitly accounting for the model's hierarchical structure can lead to significantly tighter parameter constraints. We ground our discussion using case studies from the physical sciences, focusing on examples from particle physics and cosmology.},

Chemo-dynamical studies of the stellar halo near the Sun have indicated the presence of multiple components3, such as streams4 and clumps5, as well as correlations between the stars' chemical abundances and orbital parameters6--8. Recently, analyses of two large stellar surveys9,10 revealed the presence of a well populated elemental abundance sequence7,11, two distinct sequences in the colour--magnitude diagram12 and a prominent, slightly retrograde kinematic structure13,14 in the halo near the Sun, which may trace an important accretion event experienced by the Galaxy15. However, the link between these observations and their implications for Galactic history is not well understood. Here we report an analysis of the kinematics, chemistry, age and spatial distribution of stars that are mainly linked to two major Galactic components: the thick disk and the stellar halo. We demonstrate that the inner halo is dominated by debris from an object that at infall was slightly more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud, and which we refer to as Gaia--Enceladus. The stars that originate in Gaia--Enceladus cover nearly the full sky, and their motions reveal the presence of streams and slightly retrograde and elongated trajectories. With an estimated mass ratio of four to one, the merger of the Milky Way with Gaia--Enceladus must have led to the dynamical heating of the precursor of the Galactic thick disk, thus contributing to the formation of this component approximately ten billion years ago. These findings are in line with the results of galaxy formation simulations, which predict~that the inner stellar halo should be~dominated by debris from only a few massive progenitors2,16.},

  abstract = {Classifier guidance is a recently introduced method to trade off mode coverage and sample fidelity in conditional diffusion models post training, in the same spirit as low temperature sampling or truncation in other types of generative models. Classifier guidance combines the score estimate of a diffusion model with the gradient of an image classifier and thereby requires training an image classifier separate from the diffusion model. It also raises the question of whether guidance can be performed without a classifier. We show that guidance can be indeed performed by a pure generative model without such a classifier: in what we call classifier-free guidance, we jointly train a conditional and an unconditional diffusion model, and we combine the resulting conditional and unconditional score estimates to attain a trade-off between sample quality and diversity similar to that obtained using classifier guidance.},

However, the theory of the guidance-based method not only requires the user to fine-tune the ``guidance strength'', but its target vector field does not necessarily correspond to the conditional distribution used in the training. In this paper, we develop the theory of conditional generation based on Flow Matching, a current strong contender of diffusion methods. Motivated by the interpretation of a probability path as a distribution on path space, we establish a novel theory of flow-based generation of conditional distribution by employing the mathematical framework of generalized continuity equation instead of the continuity equation in flow matching. This theory naturally derives a method that aims to match the matrix field as opposed to the vector field. Our framework ensures the continuity of the generated conditional distribution through the existence of flow between conditional distributions. We will present our theory through experiments and mathematical results.},

  abstract = {We present a simple regulator-type framework designed specifically for modelling formation of dwarf galaxies. Despite its simplicity, when coupled with realistic mass accretion histories of haloes from simulations and reasonable choices for model parameter values, the framework can reproduce a remarkably broad range of observed properties of dwarf galaxies over seven orders of magnitude in stellar mass. In particular, we show that the model can simultaneously match observational constraints on the stellar mass--halo mass relation, as well as observed relations between stellar mass and gas phase and stellar metallicities, gas mass, size, and star formation rate, as well as general form and diversity of star formation histories (SFHs) of observed dwarf galaxies. The model can thus be used to predict photometric properties of dwarf galaxies hosted by dark matter haloes in {$N$}-body simulations, such as colors, surface brightnesses, and mass-to-light ratios and to forward model observations of dwarf galaxies. We present examples of such modelling and show that colors and surface brightness distributions of model galaxies are in good agreement with observed distributions for dwarfs in recent observational surveys. We also show that in contrast with the common assumption, the absolute magnitude-halo mass relation is generally predicted to have a non-power law form in the dwarf regime, and that the fraction of haloes that host detectable ultrafaint galaxies is sensitive to reionization redshift ({$z$}rei) and is predicted to be consistent with observations for {$z$}rei 9.},

We set out to fill this gap: We provide a benchmark with inference tasks and suitable performance metrics, with an initial selection of algorithms including recent approaches employing neural networks and classical Approximate Bayesian Computation methods. We found that the choice of performance metric is critical, that even state-of-the-art algorithms have substantial room for improvement, and that sequential estimation improves sample efficiency. Neural network-based approaches generally exhibit better performance, but there is no uniformly best algorithm. We provide practical advice and highlight the potential of the benchmark to diagnose problems and improve algorithms. The results can be explored interactively on a companion website.

An index is also given to the complement of technical papers that describe various critical survey components in detail. Finally, we discuss the achieved survey performance and illustrate the variety of potential uses of the data products by way of a number of science demonstrations, which span from time series analysis of stellar spectral variations and radial velocity variations from stellar companions, to spatial maps of kinematics, metallicity, and abundance patterns across the Galaxy and as a function of age, to new views of the interstellar medium, the chemistry of star clusters, and the discovery of rare stellar species.

Our approach is simulation efficient by simultaneously estimating low-dimensional marginal posteriors instead of the joint posterior and by proposing simulations targeted to an observation of interest via a prior suitably truncated by an indicator function. Furthermore, by estimating a locally amortized posterior our algorithm enables efficient empirical tests of the robustness of the inference results. Since scientists cannot access the ground truth, these tests are necessary for trusting inference in real-world applications. We perform experiments on a marginalized version of the simulation-based inference benchmark and two complex and narrow posteriors, highlighting the simulator efficiency of our algorithm as well as the quality of the estimated marginal posteriors.},

Our approach couples source detection and catalog-based inference in a principled framework that derives from the truncated marginal neural ratio estimation (TMNRE) algorithm. It relies on the realization that detection can be interpreted as prior truncation. We outline the algorithm, and show first promising results.},

There has been much recent work on normalizing flows, ranging from improving their expressive power to expanding their application. We believe the field has now matured and is in need of a unified perspective. In this review, we attempt to provide such a perspective by describing flows through the lens of probabilistic modeling and inference. We place special emphasis on the fundamental principles of flow design, and discuss foundational topics such as expressive power and computational trade-offs. We also broaden the conceptual framing of flows by relating them to more general probability transformations. Lastly, we summarize the use of flows for tasks such as generative modeling, approximate inference, and supervised learning.},

In this paper, we introduce C-Flow, a novel conditioning scheme that brings normalizing flows to an entirely new scenario with great possibilities for multimodal data modeling. C-Flow is based on a parallel sequence of invertible mappings in which a source flow guides the target flow at every step, enabling fine-grained control over the generation process. We also devise a new strategy to model unordered 3D point clouds that, in combination with the conditioning scheme, makes it possible to address 3D reconstruction from a single image and its inverse problem of rendering an image given a point cloud. We demonstrate our conditioning method to be very adaptable, being also applicable to image manipulation, style transfer and multi-modal image-to-image mapping in a diversity of domains, including RGB images, segmentation maps and edge masks.},

With the exponential growth of astronomical data, deep learning techniques offer an unprecedented opportunity to uncover valuable insights and tackle previously intractable problems. As we enter the anticipated fourth wave of astronomical connectionism, we argue for the adoption of GPT-like foundation models fine-tuned for astronomical applications. Such models could harness the wealth of high-quality, multimodal astronomical data to serve state-of-the-art downstream tasks.

The RAVE program started in 2003, obtaining medium-resolution spectra (median R {$\frac{1}{4}$} 7500) in the Ca-triplet region (8410--8795 8) for southern hemisphere stars drawn from the Tycho-2 and SuperCOSMOS catalogs, in the magnitude range 9 {$<$} I {$<$} 12. The first data release is described in this paper and contains radial velocities for 24,748 individual stars (25,274 measurements when including reobservations). Those data were obtained on 67 nights between 2003 April 11 and 2004 April 3. The total sky coverage within this data release is \$4760 deg2. The average signal-to-noise ratio of the observed spectra is 29.5, and 80\% of the radial velocities have uncertainties better than 3.4 km s{\`A}1. Combining internal errors and zero-point errors, the mode is found to be 2 km s{\`A}1. Repeat observations are used to assess the stability of our radial velocity solution, resulting in a variance of 2.8 km s{\`A}1. We demonstrate that the radial velocities derived for the first data set do not show any systematic trend with color or signal-to-noise ratio. The RAVE radial velocities are complemented in the data release with proper motions from Starnet 2.0, Tycho-2, and SuperCOSMOS, in addition to photometric data from the major optical and infrared catalogs (Tycho-2, USNO-B, DENIS, and the Two Micron All Sky Survey). The data release can be accessed via the RAVE Web site.},

We show that both propositions can be, and are, simultaneously true. We adopt a machine-learning technique known as normalizing flow to reconstruct the probability distribution of Milky Way disk stars in the space of 15 elemental abundances measured by APOGEE. Conditioning on               T               eff               and                                                                                                        log                                      g                                                                minimizes the differential systematics. After further conditioning on [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe], the residual scatter for most abundances is               {$\sigma$}                                [                 X                 /H]                              {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.02 dex, consistent with APOGEE's reported statistical uncertainties of {$\sim$}0.01--0.015 dex and intrinsic scatter of 0.01--0.02 dex. Despite the small scatter, residual abundances display clear correlations between elements, which we show are too large to be explained by measurement uncertainties or by the finite sampling noise. We must condition on at least seven elements to reduce the correlations to a level consistent with the observational uncertainties. Our results demonstrate that cross-element correlations are a much more sensitive probe of a hidden structure than dispersion, and they can be measured precisely in a large sample even if the star-by-star measurement noise is comparable to the intrinsic scatter. We conclude that many elements have an independent story to tell, even for the               mundane               disk stars and elements produced by the core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae. The only way to learn these lessons is to measure the abundances directly, and not merely infer them.},

We introduce the generalized conditional flow matching (CFM) technique, a family of simulation-free training objectives for CNFs. CFM features a stable regression objective like that used to train the stochastic flow in diffusion models but enjoys the efficient inference of deterministic flow models. In contrast to both diffusion models and prior CNF training algorithms, CFM does not require the source distribution to be Gaussian or require evaluation of its density. A variant of our objective is optimal transport CFM (OT-CFM), which creates simpler flows that are more stable to train and lead to faster inference, as evaluated in our experiments. Furthermore, we show that when the true OT plan is available, our OT-CFM method approximates dynamic OT. Training CNFs with CFM improves results on a variety of conditional and unconditional generation tasks, such as inferring single cell dynamics, unsupervised image translation, and Schr{\"o}dinger bridge inference.

The particle masses and force softenings are chosen to resolve the mass profile to below 1\% of the virial radius at all masses, ensuring that galaxy half-light radii are well resolved. Using the same treatment of star formation and stellar feedback for every object, the simulated galaxies reproduce the observed inefficiency of galaxy formation across cosmic time as expressed through the stellar mass vs halo mass relation, and the star formation rate vs stellar mass relation. We thus conclude that stellar feedback is the chief piece of physics required to limit the efficiency of star formation in galaxies less massive than the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {Flagship near-future surveys targeting 108 - 109 galaxies across cosmic time will soon reveal the processes of galaxy assembly in unprecedented resolution. This creates an immediate computational challenge on effective analyses of the full data-set. With simulation-based inference (SBI), it is possible to attain complex posterior distributions with the accuracy of traditional methods but with a {$>$} 104 increase in speed. However, it comes with a major limitation. Standard SBI requires the simulated data to have characteristics identical to those of the observed data, which is often violated in astronomical surveys due to inhomogeneous coverage and/or fluctuating sky and telescope conditions. In this work, we present a complete SBI-based methodology, ``SBI++,'' for treating out-of-distribution measurement errors and missing data. We show that out-of-distribution errors can be approximated by using standard SBI evaluations and that missing data can be marginalized over using SBI evaluations over nearby data realizations in the training set. In addition to the validation set, we apply SBI++ to galaxies identified in extragalactic images acquired by the James Webb Space Telescope, and show that SBI++ can infer photometric redshifts at least as accurately as traditional sampling methods---and crucially, better than the original SBI algorithm using training data with a wide range of observational errors. SBI++ retains the fast inference speed of {$\sim$} 1 sec for objects in the observational training set distribution, and additionally permits parameter inference outside of the trained noise and data at {$\sim$} 1 min per object. This expanded regime has broad implications for future applications to astronomical surveys a).},

  abstract = {Low-mass ``dwarf'' galaxies represent the most significant challenges to the cold dark matter (CDM) model of cosmological structure formation. Because these faint galaxies are (best) observed within the Local Group (LG) of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31), understanding their formation in such an environment is critical. We present first results from the Latte Project: the Milky Way on Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE). This simulation models the formation of an MW-mass galaxy to z = 0 within {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology, including dark matter, gas, and stars at unprecedented resolution: baryon particle mass of 7070 M with gas kernel/softening that adapts down to 1 pc (with a median of 25--60 pc at z = 0). Latte was simulated using the GIZMO code with a mesh-free method for accurate hydrodynamics and the FIRE-2 model for star formation and explicit feedback within a multi-phase interstellar medium. For the first time, Latte self-consistently resolves the spatial scales corresponding to half-light radii of dwarf galaxies that form around an MW-mass host down to Mstar  105 M. Latte's population of dwarf galaxies agrees with the LG across a broad range of properties: (1) distributions of stellar masses and stellar velocity dispersions (dynamical masses), including their joint relation; (2) the mass--metallicity relation; and (3) diverse range of star formation histories, including their mass dependence. Thus, Latte produces a realistic population of dwarf galaxies at Mstar  105 M that does not suffer from the ``missing satellites'' or ``too big to fail'' problems of small-scale structure formation. We conclude that baryonic physics can reconcile observed dwarf galaxies with standard {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology.},

  abstract = {Normalizing Flows (NFs) are able to model complicated distributions pY (y) with strong inter-dimensional correlations and high multimodality by transforming a simple base density pZ(z) through an invertible neural network under the change of variables formula. Such behavior is desirable in multivariate structured prediction tasks, where handcrafted per-pixel loss-based methods inadequately capture strong correlations between output dimensions. We present a study of conditional normalizing flows (CNFs), a class of NFs where the base density to output space mapping is conditioned on an input x, to model conditional densities pY {\textbar}X (y{\textbar}x). CNFs are efficient in sampling and inference, they can be trained with a likelihood-based objective, and CNFs, being generative flows, do not suffer from mode collapse or training instabilities. We provide an effective method to train continuous CNFs for binary problems and in particular, we apply these CNFs to super-resolution and vessel segmentation tasks demonstrating competitive performance on standard benchmark datasets in terms of likelihood and conventional metrics.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations generate data within weeks or months. Their results consist of a random sub-sample of possible galaxies with a fixed number of stars. We propose a ML based method, GalacticFlow, that generalizes such results. We use normalizing flows to learn the extended distribution function of galaxies conditioned on global galactic parameters. GalacticFlow then provides a continuized and condensed representation of the ensemble of galaxies in the data. Thus, essentially compressing large amounts of explicit simulation data into a small implicit generative model. Our model is able to evaluate any galaxy eDF given by a set of global parameters and allows generating arbitrarily many stars from it. We show that we can learn such a representation, embodying the entire mass range from dwarf to Milky Way mass, from only 90 galaxies in {$\sim$} 18 hours on a single RTX 2080Ti and generate a new galaxy of one million stars within a few seconds.},

  abstract = {We introduce the state-of-the-art deep-learning denoising diffusion probabilistic model as a method to infer the volume or number density of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) from projected mass surface density maps. We adopt magnetohydrodynamic simulations with different global magnetic field strengths and large-scale dynamics, i.e., noncolliding and colliding GMCs. We train a diffusion model on both mass surface density maps and their corresponding mass-weighted number density maps from different viewing angles for all the simulations. We compare the diffusion model performance with a more traditional empirical two-component and three-component power-law fitting method and with a more traditional neural network machine-learning approach. We conclude that the diffusion model achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement on the accuracy of predicting number density compared to that by other methods. We apply the diffusion method to some example astronomical column density maps of Taurus and the infrared dark clouds G28.37+0.07 and G35.39-0.33 to produce maps of their mean volume densities.},
